The company razed the Bunong’s fruit orchards, rice fields, homes and trees – even their places of worship – and built a rubber plantation.

The board has been called “ineffective in practice” by the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH). The Bunong’s petition went unanswered.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"In October of that year, community representatives filed complaints with the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister’s Office, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Land Management Urban Planning and Construction. None of these bodies have ever responded.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Two months later, they met with representatives of Socfin-KCD and the Provincial Secretary to try and resolve the situation. The discussions were fruitless. Frustrated, some Bunong burned some rubber saplings, and three of the company’s excavators. That was when the army showed up. In January, six community representatives found themselves in the Provincial Court – not to make their case about the theft of their land, but to answer charges of robbery, arson and destruction of property. The charges were dropped, but police warned them they would be arrested and imprisoned if they spoke to the media or human rights groups, according to the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Over the next two years, NGOs, human rights groups, including FIDH, and local activists became involved. The company, meanwhile, began razing forests and fields, while setting up an office focused on improving relations with the community. Mostly, it focused on trying to get the Bunong to accept compensation. Some families did. Many others decided to fight on.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Feeling they had little left to lose, in 2012, the Bunong began the process of trying to register their land and receive a collective title. In 2007, Cambodia signed on to the U.N.’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Article 26 states: Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired. Article 8 section 2b reads: States shall provide effective mechanisms for prevention of, and redress for: Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources. In signing on, Cambodia is obligated to ensure that its local laws are in line with the U.N. declaration.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Cambodia does have a process for indigenous peoples to register their land. However, it is “complex, costly, lengthy and inaccessible,” according to the U.N.’s Office Of The High Commissioner For Human Rights (OHCHR). The OHCHR says that Cambodia has 455 indigenous groups. Each must apply for recognition as an indigenous community with the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of the Interior. In 2021, only 154 have received recognition. Of those, only 33 have been granted collective land titles. Van Sophat, land monitoring officer for the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR), said “The longer the registration takes, that means their identity is disappearing because businessmen and private companies will take their land.”\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"At the rate the government is moving, the OHCHR says that it would take another 100 years before all the communities would receive official recognition. For this story, it was impossible to gather enough information on indigenous land titles to map out the territory and identify instances where ELCs are encroaching on indigenous territory.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Kroeung Tola does not believe that the registration process will save his community. “Since 2012, we’ve tried to register our land to be recognized. Now in 2021, it has not been registered while the businessmen are grabbing our land,” he said, adding that no issues or flaws have been raised by bureaucrats about their application. “But the government is unwilling,” he said.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"To date, the government has not responded to the Bunong’s application for a collective title. The Bunong, however, haven’t been waiting on the government. Their faith in Cambodia’s justice system gone, 80 community members, with assistance from local international NGOs, found a lawyer in France and filed a case in 2015 with the 6th Civil Chamber of the Nanterre Judicial Court, the jurisdiction where Socfin’s parent company Bollore Group is headquartered. It is the first case in France of a parent company being tried for the actions of a subsidiary in a foreign country, according to Fiodor Rilov, the lawyer representing the Bunong.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"In July, after six years, the French court ruled against the community saying the individuals had no right to the land as they had no title documents. The court ordered the 80 plaintiffs to pay Bollore Group’s court costs of 20,000 Euro, a sum beyond their means. Rilov responded that the court ignored the U.N.Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which is international law, and overrides the need for a title document. Rilov, on behalf of the Bunong, filed an appeal to a higher French court in December.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Predicting what a higher French court will decide is anyone’s guess. In Cambodia, however, a few signs of hope may be emerging. At the same time that the French court was deciding against the Bunong, Prime Minister Hun Sen announced that people who can prove they’ve lived in a protected area for more than 10 years can be granted land titles. According to Mongabay, that “spurred a rapid surveying campaign in Mondulkiri province in the second half of the year and revealed a number of illegal land grants issued by local and national officials.”\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Whether that will result in real action, or just serve as political posturing remains to be seen. Sheila Wertz, a senior forestry officer with U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said that despite deforestation the country still has time to adjust its course, set things right and preserve its priceless forests. “Cambodia is still in a good position to secure its wealth of valuable natural resources through landscape-level approaches to forest landscape restoration and improved natural resources management.”\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"There is plenty of guidance for Cambodian officials to follow on how to save the forests, develop the economy and respect the rights of indigenous peoples. FAO, the World Bank and other organizations have developed the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests, referred to as the VGGT. The VGGT are intended to “promote secure tenure rights and equitable access to land, fisheries and forests with respect to all forms of tenure: public, private, communal, indigenous, customary and informal,” according to FAO.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Human rights defender Van Sophat agrees that Cambodia needs development. But it “needs development with transparency and justice,” he said. Opposition lawmaker Mu Sochua said rural development should be “a whole package that includes access to equal, fair information,  capital, resources. Economic Land Concessions and land grabbing have been a disaster. Cambodia is not for sale.”\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"For Song Pro, the little hope she has is fading. She has watched, powerless, as high-ranking military officials and businessmen have claimed more of her sacred forest. “Our land is now the ‘seen land,’ “ she said, its potential value having caught the eyes of the wealthy and connected who have designs upon it. “Every time that I pass our land, I look at it and worry they will never return it,” she said. “It always makes me feel bad.”\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"END\"}]},{\"section_title\":\"Methodology\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Data reliability is a major challenge because of the lack of data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery and the  Ministry of the Environment in Cambodia.\"},{\"type\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Tree cover loss data sourced from Global Forest Watch was used to analyze Forest loss in Cambodia, carbon emission as a result of biomass loss and Forest loss within the Wildlife Sanctuary where the boundary data was sourced from Open Development Cambodia (ODC).
